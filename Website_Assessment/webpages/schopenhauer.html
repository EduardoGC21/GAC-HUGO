        <h1> Arthur Schopenhauer</h1>
        <p> <strong>Born in 1788 A.D. and died in 1860 A.D.</strong><br>
          Arthur Schopenhauer, also known as the pessimist philosopher, was a German philosopher. He wrote The World as Will and Representation.
          He developed his philosophical idealist system over Kant’s work. He wrote pessimistic views, despite some being true; he was vastly influential over Nietzsche’s texts.
