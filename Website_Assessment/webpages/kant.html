        <h1> Immanuel Kant </h1>
        <p> <strong>Born in 1724 A.D. died in 1804 A.D.</strong><br>
          Immanuel Kant was a famous German philosopher; he developed the now known philosophic era Idealism.
          He wrote Critique of pure reason, where, after Descartes questions reality, he develops an epistemology, because you are only sure of your existence, so you need to have the truth of the objects.
          Thanks to this, he developed how you get to know things and thus reality, where you only know the phenomenon, not the being by itself.
          Also, he tries to make a scientific, philosophical system and developed Transcendental Idealism. He wrote about politics, the illustration, the sublime, morality, and many more topics.

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <strong><i><p>"Dare to think!"</p>
        <p>"All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason."</p>
        <p>"Whereas the beautiful is limited, the sublime is limitless, so that the mind in the presence of the sublime, attempting to imagine what it cannot, has pain in the failure but pleasure in contemplating the immensity of the attempt."</p>
        <p>"Rules for happiness: something to do, someone to love, something to hope for."</p>
        <p>"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end."</p>
