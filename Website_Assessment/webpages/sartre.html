        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <strong><i><p>"If you're lonely when you're alone, you're in bad company."</p>
        <p>"Do you think that I count the days? There is only one day left, always starting over: it is given to us at dawn and taken away from us at dusk."</p>
        <p>"We are our choices."</p>
        <p>"Man exists, then he defines himself"</p>
        <p>"My thought is me: that's why I can't stop. I exist because I thinkâ€¦ and I can't stop myself from thinking. At this very moment - it's frightful - if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing. I am the one who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire."</p>
